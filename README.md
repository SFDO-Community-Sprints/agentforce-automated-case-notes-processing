# Project "Truffle Hog"

## About this Project
The goal of this project is to create an Agent-driven augmentation of NonProfit Cloud Case Management which parses Interaction Summaries to generate theme "tags" and follow up tasks.  

## Project Progress Summary

### Project Start - Agentforce Sprint in SFO - December 2025
The initial idea for this project emerged from the ideation exercise at the beginning of this Sprint.  The goal is to speed processing of large volumes of text information inputting during the course of providing services into two major actionable/usable results:
* Tags that surface general themes
* Tasks on the Program Enrollment for follow up actions

### Project Progress
At this stage, the team has:
* Identified the problem 
* Ideated a possible solution of Agent + Flow to manage this information
* Developed a data model
* Built and tested a Proof of Concept Agent which can query Interaction Summaries from the Contact and generate either theme summaries or follow up suggestions
* Built and tested a flow to "catch" the results, present them to the "Human in the Loop" for validation and/or assignment
